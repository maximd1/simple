Set of simple algorithms

1. Euclidean algorithm

In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest 
common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

2. Find duplicates in a list

Single-loop implementation

3. Files in directory

Collects all files in directory beginning from the path.
If file is directory, then new iteration begins.

4. Calculate sum of numbers in string

Calculates sum of numbers in a given string. Check, if string is numeric.

5. Mathematical induction

Mathematical induction is a mathematical proof technique.
It is essentially used to prove that a property P holds for every natural number n, i.e. for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

Nicomachus theorem:

1(3) = 1
2(3) = 3 + 5
3(3) = 7 + 9 + 11
4(3) = 13 + 15 + 17 + 19
5(3) = 21 + 23 + 25 +27 + 29

Using this theorem we can prove that 1(3)+2(3)+3(3)+4(3)+5(3) = (1+2+3+4+5)(2).
