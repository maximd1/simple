Set of simple algorithms

1. Euclidean algorithm

In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest 
common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

2. Find duplicates in a list
