Set of simple algorithms

1. Euclidean algorithm

In mathematics, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest 
common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

2. Find duplicates in a list

Single-loop implementation

3. Files in directory

Collects all files in directory beginning from the path.
If file is directory, then new iteration begins.
